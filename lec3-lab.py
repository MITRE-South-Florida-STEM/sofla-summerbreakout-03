# a. Manipulate s to print out '62'

# b. Manipulate s to print out every other character starting in position 4
# print(s[...:...:...])

# c. Manipulate s to print out the characters in positions 2 - 10 backwards
# print(s[...:...][...:...:...])

# Complete this double for loop

# Hint: To get the numeric position of the letter in the alphabet use the ord() function
